# Krzywinski's Circle

A fun and meaningful Google Chrome extension that replaces your homepage. An artful depiction of the number pi inspired by artist Martin Krzywinski. Leave behind the boring, standard Chrome home page and replace it with a mesmerizing and educational one.

## Workflow

When I began work on Krzywinski's Circle, I first had to decide how I was going render the circle and chords themselves and how I would animate said objects. I spent time finding the D3 library as well as the CircosJS library built on D3. Then I had to decide how I was going to go about calculating pi without putting undue stress on the processor. I found an API that provided pi to a given length and used that instead of calculating it myself. Finally, once written, I modified my code and directories to port it as a Chrome extension, hosting it on the Chrome Web Store.
